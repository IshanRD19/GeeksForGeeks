    "# FIND THE N-th CHARACTER\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a binary string S . Perform R iterations on string S, where in each iteration 0 becomes 01 and 1 becomes 10. Find the Nth character (considering 0 based indexing) of the string after performing these R iterations. (See Examples for better understanding)\n",

    "#### Input:\n",

    "#### Explanation : \n",
    "After 1st iteration S becomes 100110. After 2nd iteration, S = 100101101001. Now, we can clearly see that the character at 3rd index is 1, and so the output.\n",
