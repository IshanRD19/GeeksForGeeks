    "# STOCK BUY AND SELL\n",

    "The cost of stock on each day is given in an array A[] of size N. Find all the segment of days on which you buy and sell the stock so that in between those days your profit is maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Since there can be multiple solutions, the driver code will return 1 if your answer is correct, otherwise, it will return 0. In case there's no profit the driver code will return the string \"No Profit\" for a correct solution.\n",

    "### Example 1:\n",

    "#### Input:\n",
    "N = 7\n",

    "and sell it on 4th day, which will \n",

    "\n",
    "### Your Task:\n",
    "The task is to complete the function stockBuySell() which takes an array A[] and N as input parameters and finds the days of buying and selling stock. The function must return a 2D list of integers containing all the buy-sell pairs i.e. first value of pair will represent the day on which you buy the stock and second value represent the day on which you sell that stock. If there is No Profit, return an empty list.\n",
