    "Given a number N and a bit number K, check if Kth bit of N is set or not. A bit is called set if it is 1. Position of set bit '1' should be indexed starting with 0 from LSB side in binary representation of the number.\n",

    "### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input: N = 4, K = 0\n",
    "#### Output: \n",
    "No\n",
    "#### Explanation: \n",
    "Binary representation of 4 is 100, \n",
    "in which 0th bit from LSB is not set. \n",
    "So, return false.\n",

    "Binary representation of 4 is 100, \n",
    "in which 2nd bit from LSB is set. \n",

    "### Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input: \n",
    "N = 500, K = 3\n",
    "#### Output: \n",
    "No\n",
    "#### Explanation: \n",
    "Binary representation of 500 is \n",

    "### Your task:\n",
    "You don't have to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function checkKthbit that takes n and k as parameters and returns either true (if kth bit is set) or false(if kth bit is not set).\n",

    "**Expected Time Complexity:** O(LogN).\n",
