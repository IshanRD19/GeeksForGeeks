    "Geek and Nerd are strikers playing football with their friend the Goalie. Their energies are denoted by X,Y and Z respectively. \n",
    "Strikers can only score a goal if the Goalie's energy is a factor of their energy. For every goal scored the energy of the respective player is decreased by 1. Each save decreses the Goalie's energy by 1. The game ends when the Goalie's energy is reduced to 1. The strikers can try to goal repeatedly in any order in order to optimise the total number of goals. Geek takes the lead whenever in doubt. \n",
