    "# CHOCOLATE DISTRIBUTION PROBLEM\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array A[ ] of positive integers of size N, where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are M students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among M students such that :\n",

    "1. Each student gets exactly one packet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number of chocolates given to a student is minimum.\n",

    "You don't need to take any input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findMinDiff() which takes array A[ ], N and M as input parameters and returns the minimum possible difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number of chocolates given to a student.\n",
