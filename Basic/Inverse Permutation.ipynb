    "# INVERSE PERMUTATION\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array A of size n of integers in the range from 1 to n, we need to find the inverse permutation of that array.\n",
    "Inverse Permutation is a permutation which you will get by inserting position of an element at the position specified by the element value in the array. For better understanding, consider the following example:\n",
    "Suppose we found element 4 at position 3 in an array, then in reverse permutation, we insert 3 (position of element 4 in the array) in position 4 (element value).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input:\n",
    "N = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Arr[] = {1, 4, 3, 2}\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "1 4 3 2\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "For element 1 we insert position of 1 from arr1 i.e 1 at position 1 in arr2. For element 4 in arr1, we insert 2 from arr1 at position 4 in arr2. Similarly, for element 2 in arr1, we insert position of 2 i.e 4 in arr2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input:\n",
    "N = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 1}\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "5 1 2 3 4\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "As index 1 has value 2 so 1 will b placed at index 2, similarly 2 has 3 so 2 will be placed at index 3 similarly 3 has 4 so placed at 4, 4 has 5 so 4 placed at 5 and 5 has 1 so placed at index 1. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task:  \n",
    "You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function inversePermutation() which takes the array Arr[] and its size N as inputs and returns the vector array after performing inverse permutation on Arr.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(N)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5\n",
    "\n",
    "1 ≤ A[i] ≤ N\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Array should contain unique elements and should have all elements from 1 to N."
