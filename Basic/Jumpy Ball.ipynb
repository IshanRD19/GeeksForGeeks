    "You have a jumpy ball. You throw it up from the ground up to a height of H. The ball is jumpy, so when it comes back to the ground, it rebounds and goes up again to a distance of floor(H/2). This keeps on repeating until it can't rebound anymore. You need to find the total distance traveled by the ball.\n",

    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "H is 10. From ground to H it travels d=10. From H to ground it travels d=10+10. Now H becomes floor(10/2). So ball rebounds to d=10+10+5. It goes down to the ground. d=10+10+5+5. Now H becomes floor(5/2). So ball rebounds to d=10+10+5+5+2.\n",
    "The ball goes down. d=10+10+5+5+2+2. H becomes floor(2/2). So ball rebounds to d=10+10+5+5+2+2+1.\n",
    "It goes down to the ground. d=10+10+5+5+2+2+1+1. H becomes floor(1/2). H is zero so no rebound. Total d=36.\n",

    "#### Your Task:  \n",
    "You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function jumpyBall() which takes an integer H as an input parameter and returns the total distance traveled by the ball.\n",
